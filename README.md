# Charter Code Challenge

I am sorry that this took so long to get to you. I have been trying to find time to build this in between my other duties. This app needs some clean up, especially from the ui, but I believe it has all of the required functionality. I wanted to get you at least something.

Thanks for your consideration,

Conner Vick
